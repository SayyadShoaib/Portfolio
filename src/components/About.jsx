            skills and gaining practical experience through project-based
            learning. Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's degree in ME from
            KLE College Of Engineering and Technology. I completed my 12th grade
            education from KLE Independent PU College , where I developed a
            passion for technology and problem-solving. I am eager to apply all
            my skills to real-world projects as a full-stack web developer.
